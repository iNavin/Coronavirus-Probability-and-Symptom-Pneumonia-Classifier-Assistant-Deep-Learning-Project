# Coronavirus-Probability-and-Symptom-Pneumonia-Classifier-Assistant-Deep-Learning-Project
In this we have tried to create a model with deep learning that could predict the probability of coronavirus a person is having based the symptoms that we have taken as input. and In this application we can also detect whether the affected covid19 patient is suffering from pneumonia which is severe symptom of coronavirus.
